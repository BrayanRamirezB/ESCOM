@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\braya\downloads\arquitectura de computadoras\09-project3erparcial\vhdls-oscilador\div00.vhdl":20:4:20:5|Found inferred clock oscint00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including K0200.D01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
