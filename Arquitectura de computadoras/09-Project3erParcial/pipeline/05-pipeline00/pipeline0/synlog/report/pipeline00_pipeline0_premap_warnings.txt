@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\mau\documents\arqui\practicas\tercelparcial\05-pipeline00\pipeline0\source\div00.vhd":22:2:22:3|Found inferred clock oscint00|osc_int0_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including FSM00.C01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
