@W: MT529 :"c:\users\braya\downloads\arquitectura de computadoras\06-projectdiamond-1erparc\12_13_divosc00\div00.vhd":22:2:22:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int0_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including C01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
